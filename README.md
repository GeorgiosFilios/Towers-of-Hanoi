# Towers-of-Hanoi

This is a simple command-line game of Towers of Hanoi. The purpose of the game is to move all the discs from the left stack to the right stack. A disc can only be placed on top of another disc if it is smaller in size. Only one disc may be moved from one stack to another at a time.
